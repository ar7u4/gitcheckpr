# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
     branches: [ "main" ]
  #pull_request:
  #  branches: [ "main" ]

  # schedule:
  #   # Runs every 15 minutes
  #   - cron: "*/15 * * * *"
  # # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  # workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
